# What I learned

- JavaScript represents floating-point numbers in binary, which can sometimes result in inaccuracies when converting them to their decimal representations. This can lead to unexpected behavior, particularly when you're dealing with numbers with multiple decimal places.
  - e.g. 1.23 + 1.23 = 2.460000000000001

# What I struggled

- How to ensure completing fetch data before rendering.
- How to add event listener in quoted dom element.

# Future improvement

- Implementation

  - Remove shopping cart rendering logic from app class.
  - Make some elements component such as button to reuse.

- UI/UX

  - In a cart, same item should be populated and qty should be displayed.
  - If a cart will be shrink and sticky to the top, it would be helpful to see the change of the cart.

- Functionality
  - Cart should be able to clear
  - Same Item can be added or reduced in a cart.
